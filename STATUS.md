## Lessons

| # | Lesson | State | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|-------|
| P1 | What is sound? (prologue) | ✅ done | ELI5 rewrite of the old one-page prologue: air wiggles → clicks-fuse-into-a-note morph, pitch/loudness sliders, octave ×2, 12 steps, keyboard+MIDI, harmonics stack |
| P2 | Scales & the acid mood (prologue) | ✅ done | intervals, interactive scale index (w/ 2026-07-02 playback fixes: correct root, per-scale chord, lands home, keys flash), modes, West vs East microtones, cheat-sheet |
| P3 | Sound as numbers (prologue) | ✅ done | NEW: CS side of audio — sampling canvas, Nyquist fold sweep you can hear, bitcrush demos, buffers/latency readout, synthesize sine/square/saw/noise from a for-loop |
| 00 | Oscillator & the scope | ✅ done | vanilla Web Audio, scope + spectrum, 4 waveforms |
| 01 | Gain & envelopes (ADSR) | ✅ done | VCA + ADSR, live envelope graph w/ playhead, presets |
| 02 | Low-pass filter & cutoff | ✅ done | single biquad lowpass (Q=0.707, reso saved for 03), live getFrequencyResponse curve + cutoff marker on log spectrum, bypass A/B, auto-sweep, saw/square/noise sources |
| 03 | Resonance & the squelch | ✅ done | reso knob (Q in dB on stage 2 only), 12/24 dB slope toggle (chained biquads), impulse "ping" that rings at cutoff, dB-scale response curve. 2026-07-03: reworked ★ squelch from a slow held sweep (clipped to 2.17, sounded like a pad) into a plucky repeating A-minor-pentatonic riff w/ per-note filter env (env-mod+decay preview) via mini lookahead scheduler; added resonance makeup-gain so high-Q no longer clips |
| 04 | Under the hood — real hardware | ✅ done | (was optional; built as a hardware deep-dive on request) real analog VCO (capacitor-ramp sawtooth animation + exp converter / 1V-oct / temp-drift), the 303's actual circuits (single VCO, diode-ladder VCF = transistors-as-diodes, ~18 dB, interacting poles, tuned NOT to self-oscillate, Devil Fish), then the real ladder as an **AudioWorklet** (inline Blob URL, 4× TPT one-pole cascade + tanh feedback + noise seed) that **self-oscillates** (biquad A/B, "🎵 filter sings a tune" via cutoff). Web-checked facts |
| 05 | The 303 voice | ✅ done | first assembly: osc(saw/sq) → 24 dB filter → VCA amp env, monophonic (held-note stack, last-note priority), playable keyboard (mouse + A..K, Z/X octave), cutoff/reso/amp-decay/vol, live filter curve, signal-chain diagram. Filter env deferred to 06 |
| ♬ | Interlude · Mono vs poly | ✅ done | voice-allocation demo built on request (follow-up to polyphony chat): pool of 6 persistent voices, VOICES knob (1=mono), chord buttons, live voice-rack showing each note grab a free voice or steal the oldest (red flash); readout narrates "N notes → V voices → S stolen"; ties back to shared-patch/global-tone point |
| ♪ | Interlude · Notes vs tone | ✅ done | conceptual bridge built on request (Valentin: "how do notes affect the sound? 16 A's and a G in the middle — what is that?"). A note = an oscillator frequency; a bassline = a list of them fed to osc.frequency per step. Big live Hz readout, tappable 16-step note lane w/ "16 A's" / "put a G" presets, separate TONE(cutoff) knob to show tune vs tone are independent axes |
| 303 | Interlude · The TB-303 story | ✅ done | history (Roland's failed bass machine → DJ Pierre/Phuture discovery → Acid Tracks 1987) + how the real 303 is programmed; same bassline "tame vs live acid morph" demo, 16-step sequencer grid w/ playhead, panel-map of every knob→lesson. Reuses 00–06 voice, web-searched facts, sits after 06 |
| 06 | Filter env: Env Mod + Decay | ✅ done | per-note envelope on both biquads' cutoff (floor→peak→floor, exp decay); Env Mod (0..4 oct) + Decay hero knobs; live env-shape graph + moving cutoff marker; hands-free "acid line" riff (lookahead scheduler); reuses lesson-03 resonance make-up. 2026-07-03 fix: riff sounded monotone/no-squelch — amp died to silence before the filter swept; now the note rings to ~0.28·L across the step so the sweep is audible, + baked-in accent groove (louder+brighter notes, preview of 07), punchier defaults (reso 14, floor 220, EnvMod 80) |
| 07 | Accent | ✅ done | ACCENT amount knob + clickable 16-step accent grid; accented steps scale 3 things by amount (amp ×(1+0.9a) louder, filter-env peak ×(1+a) brighter, filter decay ×(1−0.45a) snappier); playhead, live spectrum. Reuses 06 voice |
| 08 | Slide / glide | ✅ done | per-step slide flag → osc.frequency exp-ramp (portamento) into next note + legato tie (slid-into note skips amp attack & filter-env retrigger; note before a slide holds gate open); SLIDE TIME knob; pitch-over-time graph (diagonal=glide, vertical=jump) w/ gliding playhead; completes the 303 voice |
| 09 | Drive / saturation | ✅ done | (was optional; built on request) WaveShaperNode drive stage after the voice: DRIVE pre-gain + clean/soft(tanh)/hard(clamp)/fold(sin) curves, 4× oversample; live transfer-curve viz w/ signal dots + output scope; drive×resonance = the hard-acid scream (Hardfloor/Josh Wink framing) |
| 10 | The clock problem (scheduler) | ✅ done | CS centrepiece: A/B 16th-note metronome — naïve recursive setTimeout (plays on callback, drifts/jitters) vs lookahead scheduler (queues onto ctx.currentTime ~100ms ahead); 💣 main-thread busy-loop stressor exposes the difference; live beat-spacing-error bar viz + worst-jitter readout; "two clocks" framing |
| 11 | Synthesizing drums | ✅ done | 808/909 kit from scratch: kick (sine + pitch-drop env), snare (2 triangles body + HP noise snap), closed/open hat (HP noise, short/long decay), clap (4 stutter noise bursts + tail via bandpass). Playable pads (+A S D F G keys), scope, tune/decay/snap/brightness knobs, demo beat on the lesson-10 scheduler |
| 12 | The drum machine | ✅ done | 16-step × 5-drum grid (pattern = {drum:bool[16]}) firing lesson-11 voices on the lesson-10 scheduler; playhead via scheduled-time queue, tempo + swing (odd-step delay), house/techno/breaks/clear presets, tap-name row mute. Completes the rhythm half |
| 13 | 303 step sequencer | ✅ done | working TB-303: lesson-08 voice (slide/legato + accent) driven by an editable per-step grid on the lesson-10 scheduler; full 303 panel + presets + 🎲 random-walk generator, playhead. 2026-07-03: added OCT row (per-step octave switch ±12, the real 303 control) + a scale selector (min pent / nat minor / phrygian / phryg dom / harm minor / chromatic) — Phryg dom/harm minor = eastern/"Arabic" acid (P2 maqam-Hijaz); pitch now scale-index + 12·oct |
| 14 | Scales & melody | ✅ folded | not a standalone page — content lives in P2 (scales/modes/maqam), lesson 13's scale selector + octave row, and lesson 17's scale-locked random-walk generator |
| 15 | Pattern chaining | ⏭️ optional | not built — song-mode / chaining patterns into an arrangement, an optional future extension |
| 16 | Groovebox (capstone) | ✅ done | the 303 acid sequencer (13) + drum machine (12) on ONE shared lesson-10 scheduler (shared swing); master glue = tempo-synced dub delay (DelayNode+feedback, dotted-8th) + synthesised convolver reverb (procedural noise IR); acidBus/drumBus → dry + sends → master; 🎲 new jam, drum presets, full 303 panel. Loads a groove by default — press play = a track. 2026-07-03: acid grid gained the OCT row + scale selector (same as 13) — can do Arabic-flavoured acid over the beat |
| 17 | Generative acid | ✅ done | the two algorithms: Euclidean drums (per-drum pulses slider → `(i·k)%n<k` even spread, Bjorklund-equivalent) + scale-constrained random-walk melody (bounded degree walk on the scale mask, density/wander/octave/accent/slide knobs, scale selector). Reuses 303 voice + kit + clock + baked dub delay; generated patterns render on editable grids; framing = seed→loop for scoring the game |
| 18 | Shipping it | ✅ done | **course finale.** one buildEngine() used for both the live ctx and an OfflineAudioContext render; ⏺ render 2 bars offline (reports ms + N× realtime + KB), ▶ play baked buffer (loop), ⬇ download .wav (44-byte header + int16 PCM, no lib); live audio-unlock badge (suspended→running via onstatechange); live-vs-baked / latency / memory / into-the-game framing + a full-course TOC |

## Now / Next
- **THE COURSE IS COMPLETE — every lesson built, headless-verified, and live.**
  Prologue (P1–P3) → 303 voice (00–09, incl. the 04 hardware / ladder-worklet
  deep-dive) → interludes (303 story · notes-vs-tone · mono-vs-poly) →
  rhythm/clock/drums (10–12) → sequencer (13) → groovebox capstone (16) →
  generative (17) → shipping/WAV export (18). ~24 self-contained pages.
  Old `prologue-theory/` URL redirects to P1.
- **Not built, by design:** 14 (scales & melody) is folded into P2 + lesson 13's
  scale selector/octave row + lesson 17's generator; 15 (pattern chaining /
  song mode) is left as an optional future extension.
- **If extending:** song-mode (15), a shared `lib/` if duplication starts to
  hurt, and wiring the engine into the actual arcade game.

## Open questions (to align with Valentin)
1. Build pace: lesson-by-lesson with a checkpoint each, or a few at a time?
2. Library taste for knobs/grids: NexusUI (clean, code-y) vs webaudio-controls
   (photoreal hardware knobs)?
3. Authenticity vs simplicity for the filter: chained biquads (easy, 90% there)
   or go all the way to an AudioWorklet ladder (authentic, more DSP)?
4. Game target: what engine/framework is the arcade game in? Affects Module 6.

## Decisions log
- 2026-07-02: Raw Web Audio first, Tone.js later (build the scheduler by hand in
  lesson 10 before using Tone). Lessons self-contained until reuse justifies a
  shared `lib/`.
- 2026-07-02: **Pace = lesson-by-lesson** (build one, Valentin tries it, continue).
- 2026-07-02: **Filter = chained biquads first** (24 dB/oct), AudioWorklet ladder
  kept as the optional deep-dive (04).
- 2026-07-02: **Game target = web** (JS/Canvas/Phaser/Pixi). Big implication: the
  synth/sequencer engine we build can be embedded live in the game — Module 6
  favours a reusable JS engine over rendering loops to files.
- 2026-07-03: **iOS touch hardening** on all 8 widget pages (ported from
  Mudline's pattern): viewport `maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no`,
  `-webkit-touch-callout/user-select/tap-highlight` off, `format-detection=no`,
  JS veto of `gesture*`/`contextmenu` — so the long-press loupe, tap flash and
  pinch/double-tap zoom stop fighting the sliders & keyboard. Deviation from
  Mudline: body is NOT pinned (`touch-action:pan-x pan-y`, no `overflow:hidden`)
  so the lesson text still scrolls. Side effect: lesson text is no longer
  selectable — revisit if copy/zoom accessibility is wanted on the reading pages.
  `touch-action:pan-x pan-y` lives on the `*` selector (touch-action doesn't
  inherit, so an `auto` `<p>` would still double-tap-zoom); sliders + `#kbwrap`
  override to `none`.

## Standalone app — AcidBox (`acidbox/`)

The lesson-16 groovebox, lifted out of the course into a self-contained mini
app at repo root (`acidbox/index.html`) — a phone-first acid instrument with
save/load, WAV export, and shareable-link patterns. The course/lessons are
untouched; lesson 16 stays as the teaching capstone and cross-links to the app.
Will later get its own DNS/host (M7). Spec agreed with Valentin 2026-07-03.

### Milestones
| # | Milestone | State | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------|-------|
| M1 | Foundation | ✅ done | New self-contained `acidbox/` dir; lesson-16 instrument ported verbatim (303 voice + drum kit + one shared scheduler + dub delay/reverb); lesson chrome (idea panels, next/back nav) stripped; app header/footer; lesson 16 ↔ app + hub cross-links; iOS touch hardening kept |
| M2 | UX overhaul | ✅ done | **(pulled earlier — Valentin's priority)** **card-grid** layout (chosen from 3 on-device mocks — tabbed / scroll / cards): 6 cards — `303 · filter · drums · space · transport · generate` — stack in portrait, reflow 2-up at ≥640px so **303 + its filter pair on the top row** (Valentin's ask), drums+space / transport+generate below. Full-length **"DJ" faders** (chunky long-throw, big tabular readouts) on cutoff/reso/env/decay/accent · delay/fb/reverb/**volume (new)** · tempo/swing. Sticky transport bar: power/play/🎲 jam + 💾🔗⬇ placeholders tagged M3/M4; generate card dimmed/disabled til M5. Engine unchanged from M1. Headless-verified: grids fire, faders drive params live, 303+filter same row in landscape, 0 JS errors. Decision mocks (`acidbox/mocks/`) removed after the pick. Cards = seed for M6 |
| M3 | Persistence & sharing | ✅ done | one bit-packed state token (~38 bytes → **51 url-safe chars**, version-tagged) drives BOTH transports: **localStorage autosave** (debounced; restores on reload) + **named slots** (💾 modal — name/save/load/🗑) and **`#s=` share links** (🔗 copies to clipboard; opening a link applies it then strips the hash so autosave takes over = "import once"). Stores raw slider values so restore = set+dispatch (re-derives internal state, audio, readouts); power-on now reads the fx/vol sliders too (restore-safe, also fixes a latent M2 gap). Headless-verified: 40/40 codec round-trips, apply-fidelity, reload-restore, share-restore + hash-strip, slots CRUD, 0 JS errors |
| M4 | WAV export | ✅ done | refactored the live engine into a shared `buildGraph(ctx,out)` + engine-param voice/drum functions, used by BOTH the live AudioContext and an `OfflineAudioContext` — so export is **byte-faithful to what you hear** (drums + dub delay + reverb, all current knob/slider values; swing included). ⬇ renders 2 bars offline → dependency-free WAV (44-byte header + int16 PCM) → downloads `acidbox-loop.wav`; works even before power-on. Headless-verified: non-silent stereo render (peak 0.6), valid RIFF/WAVE, real ~900 KB file download, **live playback + full M2/M3 suites still green** (0 regressions from the refactor) |
| M5 | Generators & clear | ✅ done | Generate card wired to the two lesson-17 algorithms. **303 · scale random-walk** — density/wander/octaves/accents/slides knobs + 🎲 generate 303 (also the app-bar 🎲 jam); knobs set the walk's params, the roll is stochastic. **drums · Euclidean** — per-drum pulse sliders (kick/snare/cl hat/op hat/clap) spread N hits evenly (`(i·k)%16<k`) and regenerate live as you drag (deterministic → no button needed). Clears stay per-instrument (303-card `clear` · drums `clear` preset). Generator params are session-only (deliberately NOT in the save/share token — the *resulting pattern* already is). Headless-verified: card enabled, gen303 = 16 in-scale notes at density 100, euclid kick4=`[0,4,8,12]` / chat7=7 hits, jam re-rolls, full M2–M4 suites still green |
| M6 | Floating control surface | ⬜ planned | **(stretch)** the control clusters become a draggable/dockable "area" that floats & repositions to suit grip/orientation — additive on M2's area architecture |
| M7 | Deploy | 🟨 partial | **Live now** at `https://acidlab.duckdns.org/acidbox/` — whitelisted in the live Caddyfile's `acidlab` block (`redir /acidbox` + `/acidbox/*` on `@allowed`, same `:8083` origin, cf. puckline's `/legacy`); ufw unchanged (no new port); runbook synced in `DEPLOY.md`. **TODO:** its own DNS/subdomain (Valentin will add) + matching Caddy vhost |

### Requests → milestones (from Valentin's spec, 2026-07-03)
1 self-contained root dir → M1 · 2 localStorage save/load → M3 · 3 WAV download → M4 ·
4 URL-encoded share links → M3 · 5 separate clear+gen per instrument → M5 ·
6 generate via the lesson-17 algos + own controls → M5 · 7 UX (groups + full-length
DJ sliders + float/reposition, phone-first) → M2 (+ M6).

### Decisions (AcidBox)
- 2026-07-03: dir = `acidbox/`; lesson 16 left intact + cross-linked (not
  replaced/redirected); UX (M2) pulled ahead of the feature milestones per
  Valentin; deploy split out as its own milestone (M7).
- 2026-07-03: **layout = card grid** (M2). Picked from 3 side-by-side mocks
  Valentin tested on-device (tabbed console / single scroll / card grid).
  Portrait stack order `303 · filter · drums · space · transport · generate`
  chosen so a 2-col reflow pairs 303 with its filter. Added a **volume** fader
  (wired to `master.gain`) that M1/lesson-16 lacked. Generate + save/share/export
  kept as visible-but-disabled placeholders so the layout is final now.
- 2026-07-03: **persistence codec** (M3) = one bit-packed token for both
  localStorage and the `#s=` share link (not two codecs), version byte first so
  old links can be rejected/migrated. Share links are **import-once**: applied
  then the hash is stripped so local autosave owns the session afterwards (the
  🔗 button always mints a fresh link from current state).
- 2026-07-03: **unified power + play** into one button. Browsers require a user
  gesture to start audio (an `AudioContext` is born suspended; `resume()` needs a
  real tap) — so the first tap of ▶ play now creates+resumes the context AND
  starts the transport, then toggles play/stop after. Removes the separate ⏻
  power button and makes a shared-link recipient's single tap do everything.
  wave / jam / clear are now always enabled (they edit the pattern/params, which
  `buildGraph()` reads at power-on). NB: headless Chromium does NOT enforce the
  autoplay policy (context is born `running` even without the bypass flag), so
  this gating isn't visible in the Playwright suite — verified by reasoning +
  the documented policy, not a headless test.
- 2026-07-03: **WAV export = shared graph** (M4). Instead of duplicating the DSP
  (drift risk) or shipping lesson-18's slim 303-only render, one `buildGraph()`
  + engine-param voice/drum fns run on both the live ctx and an
  `OfflineAudioContext` (engine passed as arg; live nodes still destructured to
  globals for the control handlers). Export is therefore always exactly the live
  sound. Renders 2 bars + 1.3 s tail — a clip, not a seamless loop (tail bleed);
  fine for a game clip, revisit if gapless looping is wanted.
