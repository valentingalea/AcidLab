## Lessons

| # | Lesson | State | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|-------|
| P1 | What is sound? (prologue) | ✅ done | ELI5 rewrite of the old one-page prologue: air wiggles → clicks-fuse-into-a-note morph, pitch/loudness sliders, octave ×2, 12 steps, keyboard+MIDI, harmonics stack |
| P2 | Scales & the acid mood (prologue) | ✅ done | intervals, interactive scale index (w/ 2026-07-02 playback fixes: correct root, per-scale chord, lands home, keys flash), modes, West vs East microtones, cheat-sheet |
| P3 | Sound as numbers (prologue) | ✅ done | NEW: CS side of audio — sampling canvas, Nyquist fold sweep you can hear, bitcrush demos, buffers/latency readout, synthesize sine/square/saw/noise from a for-loop |
| 00 | Oscillator & the scope | ✅ done | vanilla Web Audio, scope + spectrum, 4 waveforms |
| 01 | Gain & envelopes (ADSR) | ✅ done | VCA + ADSR, live envelope graph w/ playhead, presets |
| 02 | Low-pass filter & cutoff | ✅ done | single biquad lowpass (Q=0.707, reso saved for 03), live getFrequencyResponse curve + cutoff marker on log spectrum, bypass A/B, auto-sweep, saw/square/noise sources |
| 03 | Resonance & the squelch | ✅ done | reso knob (Q in dB on stage 2 only), 12/24 dB slope toggle (chained biquads), impulse "ping" that rings at cutoff, dB-scale response curve. 2026-07-03: reworked ★ squelch from a slow held sweep (clipped to 2.17, sounded like a pad) into a plucky repeating A-minor-pentatonic riff w/ per-note filter env (env-mod+decay preview) via mini lookahead scheduler; added resonance makeup-gain so high-Q no longer clips |
| 04 | Ladder filter (AudioWorklet) | ⏭️ optional | |
| 05 | The 303 voice | ✅ done | first assembly: osc(saw/sq) → 24 dB filter → VCA amp env, monophonic (held-note stack, last-note priority), playable keyboard (mouse + A..K, Z/X octave), cutoff/reso/amp-decay/vol, live filter curve, signal-chain diagram. Filter env deferred to 06 |
| ♬ | Interlude · Mono vs poly | ✅ done | voice-allocation demo built on request (follow-up to polyphony chat): pool of 6 persistent voices, VOICES knob (1=mono), chord buttons, live voice-rack showing each note grab a free voice or steal the oldest (red flash); readout narrates "N notes → V voices → S stolen"; ties back to shared-patch/global-tone point |
| ♪ | Interlude · Notes vs tone | ✅ done | conceptual bridge built on request (Valentin: "how do notes affect the sound? 16 A's and a G in the middle — what is that?"). A note = an oscillator frequency; a bassline = a list of them fed to osc.frequency per step. Big live Hz readout, tappable 16-step note lane w/ "16 A's" / "put a G" presets, separate TONE(cutoff) knob to show tune vs tone are independent axes |
| 303 | Interlude · The TB-303 story | ✅ done | history (Roland's failed bass machine → DJ Pierre/Phuture discovery → Acid Tracks 1987) + how the real 303 is programmed; same bassline "tame vs live acid morph" demo, 16-step sequencer grid w/ playhead, panel-map of every knob→lesson. Reuses 00–06 voice, web-searched facts, sits after 06 |
| 06 | Filter env: Env Mod + Decay | ✅ done | per-note envelope on both biquads' cutoff (floor→peak→floor, exp decay); Env Mod (0..4 oct) + Decay hero knobs; live env-shape graph + moving cutoff marker; hands-free "acid line" riff (lookahead scheduler); reuses lesson-03 resonance make-up. 2026-07-03 fix: riff sounded monotone/no-squelch — amp died to silence before the filter swept; now the note rings to ~0.28·L across the step so the sweep is audible, + baked-in accent groove (louder+brighter notes, preview of 07), punchier defaults (reso 14, floor 220, EnvMod 80) |
| 07 | Accent | ✅ done | ACCENT amount knob + clickable 16-step accent grid; accented steps scale 3 things by amount (amp ×(1+0.9a) louder, filter-env peak ×(1+a) brighter, filter decay ×(1−0.45a) snappier); playhead, live spectrum. Reuses 06 voice |
| 08 | Slide / glide | ✅ done | per-step slide flag → osc.frequency exp-ramp (portamento) into next note + legato tie (slid-into note skips amp attack & filter-env retrigger; note before a slide holds gate open); SLIDE TIME knob; pitch-over-time graph (diagonal=glide, vertical=jump) w/ gliding playhead; completes the 303 voice |
| 09 | Drive / saturation | ✅ done | (was optional; built on request) WaveShaperNode drive stage after the voice: DRIVE pre-gain + clean/soft(tanh)/hard(clamp)/fold(sin) curves, 4× oversample; live transfer-curve viz w/ signal dots + output scope; drive×resonance = the hard-acid scream (Hardfloor/Josh Wink framing) |
| 10 | The clock problem (scheduler) | ✅ done | CS centrepiece: A/B 16th-note metronome — naïve recursive setTimeout (plays on callback, drifts/jitters) vs lookahead scheduler (queues onto ctx.currentTime ~100ms ahead); 💣 main-thread busy-loop stressor exposes the difference; live beat-spacing-error bar viz + worst-jitter readout; "two clocks" framing |
| 11 | Synthesizing drums | ✅ done | 808/909 kit from scratch: kick (sine + pitch-drop env), snare (2 triangles body + HP noise snap), closed/open hat (HP noise, short/long decay), clap (4 stutter noise bursts + tail via bandpass). Playable pads (+A S D F G keys), scope, tune/decay/snap/brightness knobs, demo beat on the lesson-10 scheduler |
| 12 | The drum machine | ⬜ planned | |
| 13 | 303 step sequencer | ⬜ planned | |
| 14 | Scales & melody | ⬜ planned | |
| 15 | Pattern chaining | ⏭️ optional | |

## Now / Next
- **Now:** Prologue (3 ELI5 parts), Module 0 (00 + 01), Module 1 (02 + 03),
  Module 2 complete (05–08, the full 303 voice), the 303-story interlude, and
  Module 3's opener (10 — the clock/scheduler) all live.
  Old `prologue-theory/` URL redirects to P1.
- **Next:** Lesson 11 (synthesizing drums — 909 kick/snare/hats from scratch),
  then 12 (the 16-step drum machine on the new clock). Lesson 09 (drive) and 04
  (AudioWorklet ladder) stay optional.

## Open questions (to align with Valentin)
1. Build pace: lesson-by-lesson with a checkpoint each, or a few at a time?
2. Library taste for knobs/grids: NexusUI (clean, code-y) vs webaudio-controls
   (photoreal hardware knobs)?
3. Authenticity vs simplicity for the filter: chained biquads (easy, 90% there)
   or go all the way to an AudioWorklet ladder (authentic, more DSP)?
4. Game target: what engine/framework is the arcade game in? Affects Module 6.

## Decisions log
- 2026-07-02: Raw Web Audio first, Tone.js later (build the scheduler by hand in
  lesson 10 before using Tone). Lessons self-contained until reuse justifies a
  shared `lib/`.
- 2026-07-02: **Pace = lesson-by-lesson** (build one, Valentin tries it, continue).
- 2026-07-02: **Filter = chained biquads first** (24 dB/oct), AudioWorklet ladder
  kept as the optional deep-dive (04).
- 2026-07-02: **Game target = web** (JS/Canvas/Phaser/Pixi). Big implication: the
  synth/sequencer engine we build can be embedded live in the game — Module 6
  favours a reusable JS engine over rendering loops to files.
- 2026-07-03: **iOS touch hardening** on all 8 widget pages (ported from
  Mudline's pattern): viewport `maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no`,
  `-webkit-touch-callout/user-select/tap-highlight` off, `format-detection=no`,
  JS veto of `gesture*`/`contextmenu` — so the long-press loupe, tap flash and
  pinch/double-tap zoom stop fighting the sliders & keyboard. Deviation from
  Mudline: body is NOT pinned (`touch-action:pan-x pan-y`, no `overflow:hidden`)
  so the lesson text still scrolls. Side effect: lesson text is no longer
  selectable — revisit if copy/zoom accessibility is wanted on the reading pages.
  `touch-action:pan-x pan-y` lives on the `*` selector (touch-action doesn't
  inherit, so an `auto` `<p>` would still double-tap-zoom); sliders + `#kbwrap`
  override to `none`.
